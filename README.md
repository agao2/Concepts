# Concepts
This repository will contain code that is meant to be a refresher to old programming concepts. It will consists of examples that illustrate programming concepts, mainly in C# but in the future it might extend to other languages as well. 
This repo is mainly used by me for refreshing old programming concepts , each program.cs file will probably have comments that reflect my notetaking. 

# Format
